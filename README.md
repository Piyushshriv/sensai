This ensures high performance and SEO-friendly pages, which is crucial for a platform that requires dynamic user input and feedback. Next.js also facilitates seamless routing and fast page transitions, making the overall user experience fluid and engaging.

Tailwind's flexibility allows for easy adjustments to the UI, ensuring that it looks great on all devices while maintaining a consistent and modern aesthetic.

This powerful AI model analyzes user data and provides insightful career guidance, including job recommendations, resume feedback, and mock interview tips. Gemini AI helps users optimize their career strategy based on current industry trends, skills, and professional goals.

- **Prisma**: **Prisma** is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the PostgreSQL database, ensuring smooth and efficient data management. It helps store user profiles, resumes, cover letters, and mock interview results while enabling quick, type-safe queries.

- **Shadcn UI**: The application leverages **Shadcn UI**, a modern UI component library that simplifies the process of building accessible and responsive interfaces. Shadcn UI enhances the user experience by providing reusable components with a focus on usability, performance, and design consistency.
